# Pancake - SVG charts for Svelte

This is a community fork of [Rich's repo](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/pancake) since he is understandably busy.

Maintainers are early PR creators (join if you like):
- [MichaelAdamBerry](https://github.com/MichaelAdamBerry)
- [briancray](https://github.com/briancray)
- [KristerV](https://github.com/kristerv)

If you're looking to help we need better documentation and examples to begin with.
